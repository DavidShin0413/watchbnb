# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# puts "Creaing users..."
# alex = User.create!(email: "a@a.a", password: "123456")
# bob = User.create!(email: "b@b.b", password: "123456")
# charlie = User.create!(email: "c@c.c", password: "123456")
# daniel = User.create!(email: "d@d.d", password: "123456")
